        "articleAbstract": "Few multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) researches on Google research football (GRF) focus on the 11-vs-11 multi-agent full-game scenario and to the best of our knowledge, no open benchmark on this scenario has been released to the public. In this work, we fill the gap by providing a population-based MARL training pipeline and hyperparameter settings on multi-agent football scenario that outperforms the bot with difficulty 1.0 from scratch within 2 million steps. Our experiments serve as a reference for the expected performance of independent proximal policy optimization (IPPO), a state-of-the-art multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm where each agent tries to maximize its own policy independently across various training configurations. Meanwhile, we release our training framework Light-MALib which extends the MALib codebase by distributed and asynchronous implementation with additional analytical tools for football games. Finally, we provide guidance for building strong football AI with population-based training and release diverse pretrained policies for benchmarking. The goal is to provide the community with a head start for whoever experiment their works on GRF and a simple-to-use population-based training framework for further improving their agents through self-play. The implementation is available at https://github.com/Shanghai-Digital-Brain-Laboratory/DB-Football.",

Recent algorithms for the football team composition problem take into account the skill proficiency of players but not the interactions between players that contribute to winning the championship. To automate the composition of a cohesive team, we consider the internal collaborations among football players. Specifically, we propose a Team Composition based on the Football Players’ Attributed Collaboration Network (TC-FPACN) model, aiming to identify a cohesive football team by maximizing football players’ capabilities and their collaborations via three network metrics, namely, network ability, network density and network heterogeneity&homogeneity. Solving the optimization problem is NP-hard; we develop an approximation method based on greedy algorithms and then improve the method through pruning strategies given a budget limit. We conduct experiments on two popular football simulation platforms. The experimental results show that our proposed approach can form effective teams that dominate others in the majority of simulated competitions.",

        "articleAbstract": "Football (soccer) stands as the world’s most popular sport, enthralling millions of fans globally. Within the dynamic sphere of modern football, gaining comprehensive insights into the nuanced technical and physical demands placed on players is pivotal for performance optimization. This paper introduces an innovative deep learning-powered image classification algorithm for recognizing football player activities directly from videos and images. Our pioneering approach harnesses the synergistic capabilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to decipher intricate spatial–temporal patterns in player poses and motions. The methodology employs a hybrid CNN and GCN architecture. The CNN leverages consecutive convolutional and pooling layers to automatically extract discriminative visual features from input frames capturing player poses. The GCN models’ skeletal joints as graph nodes with bones as edges, performing graph convolutions to aggregate spatial and temporal information from neighboring body parts. This enables capturing localized pose dynamics. The complementary CNN and GCN outputs are fused through fully connected layers to classify player activities based on both visual appearances and pose configurations. The model is trained end to end on richly annotated football video data using a multi-class cross-entropy loss. Data augmentation and regularization techniques enhance robustness. Extensive experiments validate the proposed architecture's effectiveness, achieving 97.4% accuracy, 96% precision, 95.5% recall, 95.4% F1-score, 0.90 Matthews correlation, and 93% specificity in classifying 17 complex football activities significantly higher than previous benchmarks. Detailed ablation studies confirm the contributions of the CNN, GCN, and fused model components. The work represents a major advance in leveraging deep neural networks for accurate and granular analysis of sports performances.",

        "articleAbstract": "In sports like football, knowledge concerning physical demands is used for training sessions and matches. Inertial measurement units are often used to estimate physical demands. Catapult Sports has recently developed, based on acceleration and gyroscope data, the Football Movement Profile algorithm that enables to categorize physical demands into locomotion categories facilitating the interpretation of practitioners. The aim of this study was to assess the validity of the locomotion predictions derived from the Football Movement Profile during controlled drills. Data were collected from 41 elite youth football players executing controlled drills replicating linear locomotion at five velocities, i.e., 5.4, 12, 18, 19.8, and 21.6 km/h and non-linear locomotion. An overall good agreement (> 95%) was found for lower velocity linear movements (≤ 12 km/h), but the agreement decreased with increasing velocities (67% at 21.6 km/h). A poor agreement was found for the lower velocity non-linear movements (78%) but increased with higher velocities (> 98%). The relationship between the magnitude and type of classification errors among the players suggests that it would be beneficial to establish individual calibration thresholds for the algorithm.",

However, the traditional football player injury cycle management and monitoring system are not only insecure in data storage, but more importantly, it lacks intelligent analysis of the collected data. With the continuous development of blockchain and machine learning technologies, blockchain technology is used to collect, store, clean, mine and visualize the full-cycle data of football players' injuries, and machine learning is used to provide intelligent solutions for football players' injury recovery. This paper compared the football player's injury full-cycle management and monitoring system based on blockchain and machine learning algorithm with the traditional football player's injury management and monitoring system. The experimental results showed that the average self-processing capacity of the football player injury MMS based on blockchain and ML algorithm was 70%, while the average self-processing capacity of the traditional football player injury management and monitoring system was 50%. Therefore, the application of blockchain and machine learning algorithm in the football player’s injury full-cycle management and monitoring system can effectively improve the system’s self-processing ability.",

        "articleAbstract": "With the rapid development in information and communication technologies, the relationship among the disciplines in various fields has become closer, resulting in many new technologies based on interdisciplinary research. This article considers robot soccer training as a research topic by involving related fields, i.e., interdisciplinary research. Compared with the physical robot, its simulation has the advantages of less cost, shorter experimental period, and is beneficial to the real-life studies in this context. This article discusses the practical application and optimization techniques used for robot soccer matches and training evaluation. The main tasks are as follows. First, we analyze and build a simulation platform for robot soccer matches. The basic principles of this platform are learning, and designing a novel optimized SARSA algorithm, built using the state-of-the-art state–action–reward–state–action (SARSA) algorithm. The optimized SARSA is a reinforcement learning algorithm that uses Q-value for making critical decisions about various parameters involved in the football training. Second, this paper simulates and analyzes the proposed optimized SARSA algorithm in a single-entity environment of robot football training. We compare the two algorithms before and after the improvement in a multi-entity environment. Among the simulation results, it is found that the optimized SARSA has a more powerful performance. The simulation results prove that the robot football training evaluation based on machine learning (optimized SARSA) can better formulate the robot football training strategy after applying the reinforcement learning strategy.",

The FGO was developed by modelling the behaviour of players in randomly moving to better positions with a target of scoring a goal. It performs simple random walks independently and/or under the guidance of a coach. In fact, the players often perform long jumps to grab the ball while playing. Such jumping action was not considered in the existing FGO. This paper first proposes an enhanced FGO (EFGO) by modelling the jumping actions of players using Levy Flight mechanism. The EFGO is then combined with K-means clustering for performing multi-level segmentation of medical and other colour images. The results of six sample images clearly portray the superior performance of the proposed EFGO-based segmentation method.",

        "articleAbstract": "Deep reinforcement learning has proven to be effective in various video games, such as Atari games, StarCraft II, Google research football (GRF), and Dota II. We participated in the 2022 IEEE Conference on Games Football AI Competition and ranked in the top eight. Despite recent efforts, building agents for GRF still suffers from multi-agent coordination, sparse rewards, and stochastic environments. To address these issues and achieve good outcomes in the competition, we devised a reinforcement learning algorithm that uses deep reinforcement learning from demonstrations and policy distillation. In this study, we innovatively propose a two-stage algorithm named mimic-to-counteract reinforcement learning (MCRL) based on the historical game logs of opponents, we encountered during the warm-up session and formulated partner agents function similarly to human sparring partners, whereby they simulate opponents with diverse styles of play, enabling primary players to practice against a range of policies, they may encounter in real competitions. Additionally, we trained numerous mentor agents capable of restraining the sparring partners. We distilled their policies and amalgamated them to train a potent primary agent. Empirical results show that the proposed MCRL algorithm can efficiently search for valuable strategies with stable updates and balance the relationship between policy iteration and policy style deviation. Also, the primary agent can learn diverse but coordinated counteracting strategies and ranks in the top eight in the competition.",

Personalized health management, driven by advancements in big data analysis, feature extraction, and internet of things (IoT) has emerged as a prominent trend in the sports industry. Based on these advancements, this paper focuses on leveraging machine vision, big data, and IoT to conduct a comprehensive study for extracting football players' offense features by aiming to improve accuracy and ensure the players’ safety in sports industry. First, this paper discusses a framework for sports health, which is based on big data analysis. Next, we discuss the use of big data and feature extraction for IoT and sports health informatics. The action image of an offense for football players is collected by an intelligent camera, and the gathered imaging code is read and analyzed by radio frequency technology. Using the recognition method of offense action using deep learning and motion information, the offense action’s image features and the three-color features of video RGB are fused into deep learning features to complete the offense action recognition. Based on the offense action recognition, the Harris 3D operator is applied to construct the sequence potential function of the offense action, and the sequence possible function of the offense action is used as the operational technique for this purpose. In addition, the AdaBoost algorithm is used to comprehensively screen the characterized data of athletes' offense actions, and the filtered data are used as training samples to complete the feature extraction of athletes' offense actions. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively reduce the recognition error of offense action and improve the efficiency of action’s feature extraction and the accuracy of feature extraction.",

Network science and graph-centric methods have been previously applied to study the importance of football players and teams. In this paper, for the first time we study the macroscopic evolution of the football society from a complex network point of view. Football game records within a time window of over a century were collected and expressed in a graph format, where participant teams are represented by graph nodes and the games between them are the graph edges. We carry out community detection and temporal analysis to reveal the dynamic features and the community structures embedded within the football network, offering the evidence of a continuously expanding football society. Spatio-temporal analysis is also implemented to unveil the temporal states that represent distinct development stages in the football history. Our analysis suggests that the evolution of the game receives considerable impact not only from major sport events, but also from multiple social and political incidents. The game of football and its evolution reflect significant historical transitions and turning points, and can provide a novel perspective for the study of the worldwide globalization process.",

The greatest interest is associated with football or soccer. The purpose of this work is the design and implementation of a low-cost methodology that extracts football analytics from simple TV broadcasts, using solely computer vision techniques. In the paper, we discuss the state of the art in this field and propose an integrated pipeline that solves the problem of player localization in the court and extracts useful insights. Technical details concerning the proposed methods that enhance track player–ball movement and camera pose, along with post-analytic results, are presented. The paper concludes with some future expansions of the proposed pipeline.",

For each variable, or attribute, a proper dissimilarity measure is computed and the clustering procedure combines the dissimilarity matrices with weights objectively computed during the optimization process. The weights reflect the relevance of each attribute type in the clustering results. A simulation study and an empirical application to football players data are presented that show the effectiveness of the proposed clustering algorithm in finding clusters that would be hidden unless a multi-attributes approach were used.",

While artificial intelligence (AI) is still one of the important technologies to solve problems in metaverse. The success of AI in various fields and the development of information technology make the integration of sports industry and AI an inevitable trend. Currently, the traditional physical education is experiencing qualitative changes, and the demand of integrating AI and metaverse into physical education is becoming more and more obvious. Football teaching is an important part of physical education, and Virtual Reality (VR) has the characteristics of immersion, interaction and imagination, which can build virtual and realistic football teaching process. In this study, through 360-degree panoramic VR football teaching videos empowered by the metaverse and K-means algorithm based on machine learning under AI, we study the strategies for improving the quality of football teaching in the mobile Internet environment. Therefore, we propose K-means based optimized 360-degree panoramic VR football teaching video delivery strategy. In addition, we conduct simulation experiments under content delivery networks simulator, and the simulation results show that the proposed strategy is superior to the baselines in terms of proxy server hit ratio, byte hit ratio, mean response time and students quality of experience. Moreover, through the 360-degree panoramic VR football teaching videos learning, students can intuitively analyze the actions and improve the teaching quality. The reconstruction of football teaching environment is beneficial to promote the combination of football teaching and smart learning.",

In this paper, we choose a BP neural network model that is powerful in processing nonlinear data to perform research. According to the demand, this paper constructs a gray fuzzy prediction model based on neural network, a gray extreme learning machine prediction model, and a gray fuzzy extreme learning machine prediction combination model based on neural network. Moreover, this paper tests the neural network model by comparing actual results with predicted results. In addition, by predicting and analyzing the football league data, this article tests the three models in terms of match result prediction accuracy, data processing speed, data transmission accuracy, match analysis scores, etc., and uses statistical analysis methods to process data, and uses intuitive statistical graphs to obtain the processing results. The research results show that the gray fuzzy extreme learning machine prediction combination model based on neural network constructed in this paper can retain the advantages of a single model and effectively improve the prediction accuracy of the model and the performance of the system.",

        "articleAbstract": "The research is conducted to improve the efficiency of college football training. The long short-term memory (LSTM) + genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed based on deep learning and internet of things (IoT) intelligent wearable devices. Specifically, the LSTM makes up for the weak local searchability of GA. The research idea is to use LSTM–GA to train and simulate the network model. The experimental result reads: the LSTM–GA model converges at the 101st iteration. The model fitness is about 11% higher than GA and about 2% higher than the LSTM. Thus, the proposed LSTM–GA can plan football players' trajectory to score. Therefore, players can wear IoT-ready intelligent wearable devices to plan the optimal shooting trajectory. The research contribution is to optimize the LSTM–GA model of IoT-ready intelligent wearable devices. The proposal can improve the efficiency of college football training.",

The problem is then formulated as finding the maximum weighted matching in a complete bipartite graph, with the objective of achieving the best possible alignment between team members and the positions designated by the coach. The Hungarian algorithm is employed to facilitate this matching process. Furthermore, the approach allows coaches to select a system of distinct representatives for each position, based on the specific qualities expected from players in a given match. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through tests conducted on four teams from the 2021–2022 English Premier League. The results indicate that ITFPS produces decisions comparable to those made by successful coaches. By optimizing team formations and enabling the utilization of rotating formations, this approach not only enhances team performance but also empowers coaches to make strategic decisions while fully leveraging the potential of their players. ITFPS serves as an intelligent assistant for coaches, complementing their strategic perspectives.",
